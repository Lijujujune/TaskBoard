Usage

This is my tasks board, to allow me to drag and drop the tasks between "To Do", "In Progress" and "Done", also with overdue highlighted in RED, due within 4 days highlighted in YELLOW for others just in WHITE, and once the task is completed, I can move it to the Done list and it will turn to white automatically.

In this case, I can can clearly see how many tasks are on my list and what's the prioritization.
